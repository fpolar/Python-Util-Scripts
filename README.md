# Python-Util-Scripts
A collection of various python scripts I have written for a variety of reasons

#Pymel
The pymel folder is a collection of scripts for Maya that I have written either for personal rigs and projects, or for the classes I TA'd for at USC

#bio_beetle_lab_parser
I was a Biomedical Engineering major for a second and there was an 8 week assignment involving all of the students in the class counting and sharing their individual results, so each student could individual analyze a larger data set for the report. Once I realized we would be receiving this data in a strange string format by email every week, I decided to write a parser that would turn that string into a more helpful data

#class_import
While a TA, I would need to setup individual virtual environments for each student in my Maya classes. As I started teaching more and more classes and students, I decided to automate this process. This script parses the roster I would receive and creates folders for each student.

#imgSetDL
Reaches out to online game (Hearthstone) APIs to download High Quality versions of the games art

#generic_compression_help_script
One of my graduate classes was on image, audio, and video compression algorithms, and for many assignments we would have to submit an analysis of the algorithms with graphs of the performance in specific test cases. This script does that analysis and draws those graphs 

#MotionCaptureDataAnalysis
One of my graduate graphics classes had a motion capture project, and for this assignment we would have to submit an analysis of the algorithm with graphs of the performance in specific test cases. This algorithm does that analysis and draws those graphs
