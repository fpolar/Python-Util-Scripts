The eyes on a rig I am working on are very large and sit outside the body (ADD REFERENCE LINK OR IMAGE) which make them unique to model and rig so they can move expressively. 

This script allows for specific meshes to be swapped in and out as they are needed for different stages of eyelid animation.
